The 1989 Tour de France was the 76th edition of one of cycling's Grand Tours. The 3,285 km (2,041 mi) race began in Luxembourg with a prologue time trial on 1 July. It reached French soil during stage 4, ending in Paris on 23 July after 21 stages. Often cited as one of the most competitive runnings of the Tour, the race was decided by only eight seconds in favour of Greg LeMond (pictured), the smallest victory margin to date. Laurent Fignon, who was never separated from LeMond by more than fifty-three seconds throughout the event, finished second overall, ahead of defending champion Pedro Delgado. Fignon performed well during the mountain stages to enter the final-day individual time trial with a 50-second advantage. LeMond utilised aerodynamic triathlon tribars to gain an advantage and managed to win the Tour on the last stage. Sean Kelly won the points classification for a record fourth time, while Gert-Jan Theunisse took the King of the Mountains prize.
